# Trail Journal App

A full-stack application I'm building to complete my journal for my Continental Trail Divide Hike in 2024. I wrote in my journal, saved the locatiosn of my campsites and sent messages with my GPS device, took TONS of photos and videos. This application is my process of combining all this data into one visualization. Built with **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Tailwind CSS**.
